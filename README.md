# Ground Truther
Ground Truther is an aplication developed as a student project at Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, that allows citizen scientists to enter and retrieve evironmental data about a point of interest. This is intended to help scientists in remote sensing field to validate their results of satellite imagery analysis against observations on the ground recorded by volunteers. Specifically, volunteers can enter the coordinates of their point of observation, note the type of landscape and environmental disturbance they observe (e.g. insect infestation in a coniferous forest), specify the date of observation and upload a photo. The information can be retrieved by any user that has an account and is displayed according to the user's query on a map.    
This repository includes a full project including also a dump for an SQL database.
